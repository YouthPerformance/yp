## Adam's Preferences (from WhatsApp 1/4/26)

### DO NOT USE:
- "KD's Ex-Trainer" as primary identifier
- Kevin Durant as the main marketing hook

### USE INSTEAD:
- "NBA/WNBA Skills Trainer"
- Resume/About Me style presentation
- KD mention is OK in testimonials, not as headline

### Adam's Request:
> "I would like to NOT use (KD's Ex-Trainer) on the website when you are buying. Would like to use NBA/WNBA Skills Trainer."
>
> "I think there needs to definitely be a section of the site ABOUT ME and it lists my whole resume, where I played, where I coached and who I have worked with on every level."

## Verified Testimonials (Use These)

### Kevin Durant, Houston Rockets
> "Over the past ten years, Adam Harrington has been the driving force behind my basketball journey. As my skills trainer, coach, and mentor, he's been a constant source of motivation, pushing me to improve every single day. From my MVP season in 2014 to the recent game-changing offseason in 2023, Adam's extensive knowledge has been essential in shaping me into the basketball player I've become today."

### Spencer Dinwiddie, Brooklyn Nets
> "I got to go back to where I started with the Nets seven years ago... He took an interest in me even though I was in the G-League, a non-guaranteed guy, and showed me as much energy and enthusiasm as any coach I have been with... In terms of an in-season coach, I've never had a better player development guy that has helped me skills-wise from top to bottom, and that made me feel like family."

### Phil Handy, Los Angeles Lakers
> "Adam is one of the best basketball minds in the game. For years I've watched from afar and love his attention to detail and ability to connect with players at all levels. Watching Kevin Durant apply the balance and footwork methods has been awesome to see translate into game play. Adam has been around some of the best players in the game, the results and respect speak for itself. True teacher and student of the game."
