## Voice Recording Tips

### Do This ✓

- **Speak in complete thoughts**
  > "Speed training for youth athletes isn't about running faster. It's about moving smarter. The fastest kids aren't always the ones with the best genetics. They're the ones who've learned to use their body efficiently."

- **Use YP brand language**
  > "We call this building your chassis. A strong chassis means stable joints, reactive muscles, and the ability to explode in any direction."

- **Include specific details**
  > "This drill takes about 45 seconds. Athletes should focus on quick foot contacts, keeping ground time under 0.2 seconds."

### Avoid This ✗

- Starting with "um" or "so"
- Long pauses mid-sentence
- Reading from a script (sounds robotic)
- Whispering or mumbling
