There are three common causes:\n\n### 1. Feet Position\nIf your child's feet are perfectly square to the basket (both feet pointing straight ahead), their hip and shoulder can't align properly. This forces the elbow to flare out to compensate.\n\n**The Fix:** Turn the feet 10-15 degrees toward the shooting hand side. Right-handed shooters turn slightly right. This opens the hip and naturally brings the elbow in.\n\n### 2. Hand Placement\nIf the ball sits on the palm instead of the fingers, or if the index finger is off-center, the elbow compensates by moving out.\n\n**The Fix:** Place the index finger in the CENTER of the ball. Spread fingers wide. Ball should rest on finger pads, not the palm.\n\n### 3. Guide Hand Interference\nIf the guide hand thumb is pushing the ball, it throws off the shooting mechanics entirely. The shooting elbow flares to create space for the guide hand push.\n\n**The Fix:** The guide hand is a \"ghost\"—it balances the ball and releases BEFORE the shot. Check the thumb position after each shot. If it's pointing at the basket, it pushed.\n\n## The Wall Doesn't Lie\n\nMost coaches yell \"Tuck your elbow!\" but never explain HOW. Adam Harrington uses the **Wall Constraint Method**.\n\nStand 6 inches from a wall with your shooting side toward it. Practice your shooting motion. If your elbow flares, you'll hit the wall. The environment forces the correction without any coaching needed.\n\nThis is called \"constraint-led learning\"—the environment teaches the body what to do.\n\n## When to Worry\n\nA slight elbow flare (10-15 degrees) is normal and acceptable. Not everyone's shoulders work the same way.\n\nWhat you're looking for is:\n- **Consistent shot path** (ball goes straight, not sideways)\n- **No shoulder pain** during the motion\n- **Repeatable form** that doesn't change under pressure\n\nIf your child can shoot accurately with a slight flare and has no pain, don't force a change.\n\n## The Progression\n\n1. **Wall Shooting** (one-handed, 6 inches from wall)\n2. **Shadow Shooting** (freeze and check elbow position)\n3. **Close Range Form Shooting** (5-8 feet, one hand)\n4. **Add Guide Hand** (focus on it NOT pushing)\n5. **Move Back Gradually** (only when form holds)","src/content/parent-sidelines/fix-chicken-wing-shooting.mdx","114d30f9c8d15e87","fix-chicken-wing-shooting.mdx",true,"how-to-practice-basketball-without-hoop",{"id":468,"data":470,"body":492,"filePath":493,"digest":494,"legacyId":495,"deferredRender":467},{"question":471,"category":472,"author":14,"expertTitle":473,"publishedDate":474,"updatedDate":475,"directAnswer":476,"keyTakeaways":477,"safetyNote":482,"relatedPillar":453,"relatedDrillSlug":119,"relatedDrills":483,"keywords":484,"ctaText":490,"ctaUrl":491},"How can my child practice basketball at home without a hoop?","training-hacks","NBA Skills Coach",["Date","2026-01-08T00:00:00.000Z"],["Date","2026-01-08T00:00:00.000Z"],"You do not need a hoop to become an elite ball handler.

Without a hoop, you're forced to work on the **Engine** (your feet) and the **Steering** (your hands).\n\nThe best ball handlers in the NBA didn't become great by shooting around. They became great by developing a relationship with the ball—feeling it, controlling it, making it an extension of their body.\n\n## The \"Silent\" Advantage\n\nIf you live in an apartment, noise is the enemy. That's actually a feature, not a bug.\n\nThe **Silent Assassin** protocol forces you to absorb the ball's energy on every dribble, which actually makes your handle \"stickier\" in real games. When a defender reaches and you need to protect the ball, that soft touch is the difference between a turnover and a bucket.\n\n## The 4 Pillars of No-Hoop Training\n\n### 1.

In fact, children's feet are naturally more adaptable than adults'—they haven't spent decades in supportive shoes that weaken the intrinsic foot muscles.\n\nThe question isn't *if* it's safe, but *how* to do it safely.\n\n## Why Modern Shoes Are Part of the Problem\n\nHere's an uncomfortable truth: highly cushioned, supportive shoes act like casts. When you put a limb in a cast, the muscles atrophy. The same thing happens to feet in modern sneakers.\n\nThe intrinsic muscles of the foot—the ones that support your arch, stabilize your ankle, and provide sensory feedback—don't have to work. The shoe does the work for them.\n\nOver time, you get:\n- Weak arches (leading to flat feet)\n- Poor ankle stability (leading to sprains)\n- Reduced proprioception (leading to poor balance)\n\nBarefoot training reverses this by forcing the foot to do its job.\n\n## Who Should Do Barefoot Training\n\n- **Healthy kids with no foot problems** (the majority)\n- **Young athletes looking to improve performance** (stronger feet = better movement)\n- **Kids with mild flat feet** (often benefit from foot strengthening)\n- **Children who want to try minimalist shoes** (need progressive preparation)\n\n## Who Should Consult a Professional First\n\n- **Children with existing foot pain or conditions**\n- **Kids currently wearing orthotics** (don't stop without guidance)\n- **Children with significant structural issues** (severe flat feet, high arches)\n- **Post-surgery or post-injury** (need clearance)\n- **Diabetic children** (reduced sensation increases risk)\n\n## The 5 Non-Negotiable Safety Rules\n\n1. **Start Short** — 5-10 minutes maximum for first sessions\n2. **Soft Surfaces First** — Grass, rubber, carpet before concrete\n3. **Pain Means Stop** — Sharp pain, numbness, or tingling = stop immediately\n4. **Progress Weekly** — Add duration every 7 days, not daily\n5. **Check the Surface** — Look for glass, rocks, hot pavement\n\n## What to Expect\n\n| Timeline | What You'll See |\n|----------|-----------------|\n| Week 1-2 | Feet may feel tired after sessions. This is normal adaptation. |\n| Week 3-4 | Improved awareness and balance. Less fatigue after sessions. |\n| Week 5-6 | Noticeable strength gains.

It just temporarily removes the stress. The moment that stress returns, so does the pain.\n\n## What Actually Works\n\nJames Scott's protocol focuses on **building tendon tolerance** without the impact of jumping and running. The key is isometric loading—holding positions that stress the muscle-tendon unit without movement.\n\n### Why Isometrics Work\n\n1. **Analgesic Effect**: Isometric holds literally reduce pain signals from the tendon\n2. **Maintain Strength**: Unlike rest, you don't lose muscle\n3. **No Impact**: Loading without jumping means no stress on the growth plate\n4. **Progressive Overload**: You can gradually increase hold times as tolerance builds\n\n## The Protocol\n\n### Step 1: Kill the Pain (Isometrics)\n\nThe **Floating Heel** exercise creates an immediate pain-reduction effect. Do this every morning before activity:\n\n- Stand on a step with heels hanging off\n- Lower heels 1 inch below step level\n- HOLD for 45 seconds\n- 3 sets, daily\n\n### Step 2: Build Tolerance\n\nOnce pain is manageable (below 3/10), progress to:\n- Soleus squat holds (bent knee heel raises)\n- Single-leg balance variations\n- Wall lean isometrics\n\n### Step 3: Return to Play\n\nSever's doesn't mean \"no basketball.\" It means \"smart basketball\":\n- Perform the protocol BEFORE practice\n- Modify jumping drills temporarily\n- Monitor pain levels daily\n\n## When to See a Doctor\n\nSee a healthcare provider immediately if:\n- Pain is severe (above 5/10) even at rest\n- There's visible swelling or bruising\n- Your child is limping or can't walk normally\n- Pain doesn't improve after 2 weeks of the protocol","src/content/parent-sidelines/severs-disease-exercises-basketball.mdx","917ad593ed83515f","severs-disease-exercises-basketball.mdx"]
