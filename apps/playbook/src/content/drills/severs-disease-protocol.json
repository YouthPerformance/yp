  "description": "The definitive isometric routine to kill heel pain in growing athletes. Stop icing and start strengthening the soleus muscle where it matters most.",
  "coachNote": "James's Take: Rest doesn't fix Sever's; it just hides it. The pain comes from the calf pulling on the heel bone's growth plate. We use 'Iso-Holds' to create an analgesic (pain-killing) effect without impact. This is the same protocol I use with D1 athletes.",

    {
      "title": "The Floating Heel",
      "instruction": "Stand on a stair or weight plate with just the balls of your feet. Lower your heels 1 inch below the step level. HOLD this position without moving. You should feel tension in your lower calf.",
      "durationSeconds": 45
    },
    {
      "title": "Soleus Squat Hold",
      "instruction": "Stand with knees bent at 30 degrees. Rise onto the balls of your feet and HOLD. This bent-knee position targets the soleus—the specific muscle pulling on the growth plate.",
      "durationSeconds": 45
    },
    {
      "title": "Wall Lean Iso",
      "instruction": "Face a wall, lean forward with straight body, heels just off the ground. Hold this angled position. Your calves should burn but your heels should NOT hurt above 3/10 pain.",
      "durationSeconds": 45
    },
    {
      "title": "Single-Leg Balance (Heel Hover)",
      "instruction": "Stand on one foot, heel slightly elevated off the ground. Hold for 30 seconds each side. This builds foot stability while loading the calf isometrically.",
      "durationSeconds": 60
    }
  ],
  "coachingCues": [
    "Pain during holds should NOT exceed 3/10—if it does, reduce the hold time",
    "Do NOT stretch aggressively—this can irritate the growth plate more",
    "Perform this protocol BEFORE activity to 'pre-load' the tendon",
    "Consistency beats intensity—do this daily, not just when it hurts"
  ],
  "commonMistake": "Aggressive calf stretching thinking it will help",
  "mistakeFix": "Stop stretching during flare-ups. Use isometrics only. Stretching can actually pull harder on the irritated growth plate.",
