  "description": "The most common youth shooting error: pushing the ball with both hands like a chest pass. This drill sequence teaches proper one-hand dominance for a mechanically sound jumper.",
  "coachNote": "Adam's Take: Every kid starts by pushing the ball with two hands. It's natural—they're not strong enough yet. But if we don't fix it by age 10, it becomes permanent. The guide hand should be a 'ghost'—there but not pushing.",

      "title": "Guide Hand Awareness",
      "instruction": "Place your guide hand on the side of the ball with fingers pointing UP (not forward). This hand does NOT push—it only balances. Practice holding this position without shooting.",

      "title": "One-Hand Only",
      "instruction": "Shoot 10 shots with your guide hand behind your back. This forces your shooting arm to do all the work. Start at 3-4 feet from the basket—this is about form, not distance.",

      "title": "Thumb Check",
      "instruction": "After each shot, freeze and look at your guide hand thumb. Is it pointing at the basket? That means it pushed. It should be pointing UP or sideways, not forward.",
