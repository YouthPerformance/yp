  "description": "Master the follow-through that creates perfect backspin. Learn how to 'snap' the wrist to get that soft touch that makes the ball kiss off the rim and fall in.",
  "coachNote": "Adam's Take: A flat shot has no chance. You need rotation—backspin makes the ball 'sit down' when it hits the rim. The 'Gooseneck' isn't just a pose; it's the result of a violent wrist snap. Don't pull your hand back after release—leave it in the cookie jar.",
  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "The One-Hand Snap (Lying Down)",
      "instruction": "Lie on your back. Shoot the ball straight up and catch it. It should land back on your nose if your release is straight. Focus on backspin—you should see the lines rotating toward you.",
      "durationSeconds": 60
    },
    {
      "title": "Rim Flicks",
      "instruction": "Stand directly under the basket. Flick the ball straight up trying to swish it without hitting the rim. High arc, soft touch. This trains the 'up' in your shot, not the 'out'.",
      "durationSeconds": 60
    },
    {
      "title": "Freeze the Gooseneck",
      "instruction": "Take a shot from 8 feet. After release, FREEZE your follow-through for 2 full seconds. Your wrist should be fully flexed, fingers pointed down at the rim—like your hand is in a cookie jar on a high shelf.",
      "durationSeconds": 90
    },
    {
      "title": "Partner Check",
      "instruction": "Have a partner stand behind you. After each shot, they call out if your follow-through was 'in' (held) or 'out' (pulled back too fast). 10 shots, aim for 10/10 'in' calls.",
      "durationSeconds": 90
    }

  "coachingCues": [
    "Hold your follow-through until the ball hits the rim—every time",
    "Your wrist should snap forward and DOWN, not sideways",
    "Backspin comes from fingertip release, not palm push",
    "Think 'reach into the cookie jar on a high shelf'"

  "commonMistake": "Pulling the hand back immediately after release",
  "mistakeFix": "Count 'one-Mississippi' after every shot before dropping your arm. Build the habit of holding the follow-through.",
