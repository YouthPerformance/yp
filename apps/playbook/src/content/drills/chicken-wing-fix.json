  "description": "The #1 mechanical flaw in youth shooting. Fix the flaring elbow to straighten your shot path and increase accuracy.",
  "coachNote": "Adam's Take: Your elbow points where the ball goes. If it points right, you miss right. We fix this by shooting 'one-handed form' close to a wall. The wall doesn't lie—it gives you instant feedback that no coach can replicate.",

    {
      "title": "Wall Shooting (Form)",
      "instruction": "Stand 6 inches from a wall with your shooting side facing it. Practice your shooting motion—if your elbow flares, you'll hit the wall. The wall forces the tuck.",

      "title": "The Guide Hand Shadow",
      "instruction": "Shadow shoot without a ball. Focus ONLY on your elbow staying under your wrist throughout the entire motion. Freeze at the top of your release and check your elbow position.",

    {
      "title": "One-Hand Form Shooting",
      "instruction": "Close range, one hand only (no guide hand). Shoot 10 reps focusing on keeping your elbow pointed at the rim. No guide hand = pure shooting mechanics.",

    {
      "title": "Feet Position Check",
      "instruction": "Turn your feet 10-15 degrees toward your shooting side (right-handers turn slightly right). This naturally aligns your hip and shoulder, reducing elbow flare.",

    "Elbow should be under the ball, not beside it",
    "Your shooting hand index finger should be in the CENTER of the ball",
    "A slight foot turn (10-15 degrees) is legal and helps alignment",
    "Check your guide hand—if the thumb is pushing, the elbow will flare"

  "commonMistake": "Keeping feet perfectly square to the basket",
  "mistakeFix": "Turn your lead foot 10-15 degrees toward your shooting hand side. This opens your hip and naturally brings the elbow in.",
