  "description": "Teach the foot to create its own support system. Essential for kids with 'collapsed' ankles and flat feet. Build the arch muscles that orthotics let sleep.",
  "coachNote": "James's Take: An orthotic is a crutch. It tells your foot 'go to sleep, I got this.' We want to WAKE the foot up. If your arch cramps during these exercises, you're doing it right—those muscles haven't worked in years.",
  "steps": [
    {
      "title": "Short Foot (Seated)",
      "instruction": "Sit with feet flat on floor. Keep ALL toes flat and relaxed. Now try to 'shorten' your foot by pulling the ball of your foot toward your heel. Your arch should dome up without your toes curling.",
      "durationSeconds": 60
    },
    {
      "title": "Short Foot (Standing)",
      "instruction": "Same as above but standing. This is much harder. Feel your arch lift while keeping toes flat on the ground. Hold each contraction for 5 seconds.",
      "durationSeconds": 60
    },
    {
      "title": "Pen Pinches",
      "instruction": "Place a pen under your arch while standing. Try to lift your arch high enough that you could slide the pen out—WITHOUT curling your toes or shifting weight.",
      "durationSeconds": 60
    },
    {
      "title": "Toe Spreads",
      "instruction": "Spread all 5 toes apart like a fan. Hold for 5 seconds. This activates the intrinsic foot muscles that support the arch from below.",
