directAnswer: "The 'Chicken Wing' is rarely just a bad habit—it's often a mobility compensation or a hand-placement issue. If the shoulder lacks external rotation, the elbow MUST flare out to get the ball to the hoop. To fix it, you must first check shoulder mobility, then correct hand placement so the index finger is in the center of the ball, and finally use constraint drills like wall shooting to force the correction."
keyTakeaways:
  - "Check the Feet: If feet are perfectly square to the basket, the elbow is forced out. Turn feet 10-15 degrees toward shooting side"
  - "The Wall Drill: Practice form shooting 6 inches from a wall. The wall physically prevents the elbow from flaring"
  - "Thumb Check: Ensure the guide-hand thumb is not pushing the ball—this forces the shooting elbow out"
  - "Don't force it: Some athletes need a slight natural flare (10-15 degrees) based on their anatomy"
safetyNote: "Do not force a young child to tuck their elbow if it causes shoulder pain. Some athletes naturally require a slight flare based on their shoulder mobility. A 10-15 degree flare is acceptable."

## Why the Elbow Flares

Before you can fix the chicken wing, you need to understand why it happens. There are three common causes:

### 1. Feet Position
If your child's feet are perfectly square to the basket (both feet pointing straight ahead), their hip and shoulder can't align properly. This forces the elbow to flare out to compensate.

**The Fix:** Turn the feet 10-15 degrees toward the shooting hand side. Right-handed shooters turn slightly right. This opens the hip and naturally brings the elbow in.

### 2. Hand Placement
If the ball sits on the palm instead of the fingers, or if the index finger is off-center, the elbow compensates by moving out.

**The Fix:** Place the index finger in the CENTER of the ball. Spread fingers wide. Ball should rest on finger pads, not the palm.

### 3. Guide Hand Interference
If the guide hand thumb is pushing the ball, it throws off the shooting mechanics entirely. The shooting elbow flares to create space for the guide hand push.

**The Fix:** The guide hand is a "ghost"—it balances the ball and releases BEFORE the shot. Check the thumb position after each shot. If it's pointing at the basket, it pushed.

## The Wall Doesn't Lie

Most coaches yell "Tuck your elbow!" but never explain HOW. Adam Harrington uses the **Wall Constraint Method**.

Stand 6 inches from a wall with your shooting side toward it. Practice your shooting motion. If your elbow flares, you'll hit the wall. The environment forces the correction without any coaching needed.

This is called "constraint-led learning"—the environment teaches the body what to do.

## When to Worry

A slight elbow flare (10-15 degrees) is normal and acceptable. Not everyone's shoulders work the same way.

What you're looking for is:
- **Consistent shot path** (ball goes straight, not sideways)
- **No shoulder pain** during the motion
- **Repeatable form** that doesn't change under pressure

If your child can shoot accurately with a slight flare and has no pain, don't force a change.

## The Progression

1. **Wall Shooting** (one-handed, 6 inches from wall)
2. **Shadow Shooting** (freeze and check elbow position)
3. **Close Range Form Shooting** (5-8 feet, one hand)
4. **Add Guide Hand** (focus on it NOT pushing)
5. **Move Back Gradually** (only when form holds)
