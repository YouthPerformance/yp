  directAnswer:
    "<strong>Barefoot training builds foot strength, balance, and proprioception that translate directly to athletic performance.</strong> Start gradually on soft surfaces for 5–10 minutes, 2–3 times per week. Focus on intrinsic foot muscle activation before adding load or intensity. For youth athletes, it's safe when progressive—and it builds the foundation for quicker feet, better landings, and fewer ankle injuries.",
  keyTakeaways: [
    "Your feet have 26 bones, 33 joints, and 100+ muscles—they need training too",
    "Start on grass, carpet, or rubber flooring before harder surfaces",
    "5–10 minutes of barefoot work, 2–3x per week, creates measurable change",
    "Improved balance and foot awareness in 2–3 weeks; strength gains in 4–6 weeks",

const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Is barefoot training safe for kids?",
    answer:
      "Yes, when done progressively and on appropriate surfaces. Start with short sessions (5–10 minutes), avoid hard concrete initially, and stop immediately if there's any pain. Children's feet are naturally adaptable—barefoot training helps build the strength and sensory awareness they need for athletic performance.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to see results from barefoot training?",
    answer:
      "Most people notice improved balance and foot awareness within 2–3 weeks of consistent practice. Measurable strength gains typically appear around 4–6 weeks. Full adaptation to barefoot or minimalist training takes 3–6 months of progressive work.",
  },
  {
    question: "What surfaces are best for barefoot training?",
    answer:
      "Start on forgiving surfaces: grass, rubber gym flooring, carpet, or foam mats. These allow your feet to adapt without excessive stress. Gradually progress to harder surfaces as foot strength improves. Avoid starting on concrete or asphalt.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can barefoot training help with basketball performance?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. Stronger feet improve first-step quickness, change of direction, balance on drives, and landing stability. Many NBA players incorporate barefoot work into their training. It's foundational for any sport requiring quick footwork.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I do barefoot training exercises?",
    answer:
      "Start with 2–3 sessions per week, 10–15 minutes each. As your feet adapt, you can increase to 4–5 sessions or integrate barefoot drills into your regular warm-up. Consistency matters more than duration.",
  },

  <!-- Chapter 1: What Is Barefoot Training -->
  <SectionHeader
    id="what-is"
    chapter="Chapter I"
    title="What Is Barefoot Training?"
  />

  <p>Barefoot training is the practice of performing exercises without shoes to strengthen the intrinsic muscles of the feet, improve balance, and develop proprioception—your body's awareness of where it is in space.</p>

  <p>Your feet are your foundation. They contain 26 bones, 33 joints, and over 100 muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Most of us spend our lives in supportive shoes that do the work our feet should be doing. Over time, this leads to weak, underdeveloped feet that can't support athletic demands.</p>

  <CoachVoice author="james">
    Weak feet don't eat. That's not just a saying—it's biomechanics. If your feet can't stabilize, absorb, and produce force, you're leaking power at every step. Training your feet is training your entire kinetic chain.
  </CoachVoice>

  <p><strong>Barefoot training is NOT:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Running barefoot on pavement (that's a specific skill with different progressions)</li>
    <li>Never wearing shoes again</li>
    <li>Something you do for hours at a time</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Barefoot training IS:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Targeted exercises to build foot strength and awareness</li>
    <li>Progressive exposure to barefoot movement</li>
    <li>A supplement to your existing training</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Research shows barefoot training improves several key athletic qualities:</p>
