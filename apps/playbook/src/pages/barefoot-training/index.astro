    "<strong>Barefoot training builds foot strength, balance, and proprioception using the R3 Method: Release restrictions, Restore capacity, Re-Engineer for performance.</strong> Start with the Release phase—gentle mobility on soft surfaces for 5–10 minutes, 2–3 times per week. Progress to Restore (strength) and Re-Engineer (power). For youth athletes, it's safe when progressive—and it builds the foundation for quicker feet, better landings, and fewer ankle injuries.",

const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Is barefoot training safe for kids?",
    answer:
      "Yes, when done progressively and on appropriate surfaces. Start with the Release phase—short sessions (5–10 minutes), avoid hard concrete initially, and stop immediately if there's any pain. Children's feet are naturally adaptable—barefoot training helps build the strength and sensory awareness they need for athletic performance.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is the R3 Method?",
    answer:
      "The R3 Method is a 3-phase progression: Release (restore range of motion), Restore (build strength and capacity), and Re-Engineer (explosive power and sport transfer). It's the same sequence James Scott uses with NBA and NFL athletes. Never skip phases—each one builds on the previous.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to see results from barefoot training?",
    answer:
      "Most people notice improved balance and foot awareness within 2–3 weeks (end of Release phase). Measurable strength gains typically appear around 4–6 weeks (Restore phase). Full adaptation with explosive power takes 6–8 weeks (Re-Engineer phase) of progressive work.",
  },
  {
    question: "What surfaces are best for barefoot training?",
    answer:
      "Start on forgiving surfaces: grass, rubber gym flooring, carpet, or foam mats. These allow your feet to adapt without excessive stress. Gradually progress to harder surfaces as foot strength improves during the Restore phase. Avoid starting on concrete or asphalt.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can barefoot training help with basketball performance?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. The Re-Engineer phase specifically targets first-step quickness, change of direction, balance on drives, and landing stability. Many NBA players incorporate barefoot work into their training. It's foundational for any sport requiring quick footwork.",
  },
  {
    question: "How often should I do barefoot training exercises?",
    answer:
      "During Release phase: 2–3 sessions per week, 5–10 minutes each. During Restore: 3–4 sessions, 10–15 minutes. During Re-Engineer: 4 sessions integrated into your regular training. Consistency matters more than duration—follow the R3 progression.",

  <!-- Chapter 1: What Is Barefoot Training -->
  <SectionHeader
    id="what-is"
    chapter="Chapter I"
    title="What Is Barefoot Training?"
  />

  <p>Barefoot training is the practice of performing exercises without shoes to strengthen the intrinsic muscles of the feet, improve balance, and develop proprioception—your body's awareness of where it is in space.</p>

  <p>Your feet are your foundation. They contain 26 bones, 33 joints, and over 100 muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Most of us spend our lives in supportive shoes that do the work our feet should be doing. Over time, this leads to weak, underdeveloped feet that can't support athletic demands.</p>

  <CoachVoice author="james">
    Weak feet don't eat. That's not just a saying—it's biomechanics. If your feet can't stabilize, absorb, and produce force, you're leaking power at every step. That's why I developed the R3 Method: Release, Restore, Re-Engineer. It's the same sequence I use with Jimmy Butler, Josh Oliver, and every pro I work with.
  </CoachVoice>

  <p><strong>Barefoot training is NOT:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Running barefoot on pavement (that's a specific skill with different progressions)</li>
    <li>Never wearing shoes again</li>
    <li>Something you do for hours at a time</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Barefoot training IS:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Targeted exercises to build foot strength and awareness</li>
    <li>Progressive exposure to barefoot movement</li>
    <li>A supplement to your existing training</li>
  </ul>

    Don't skip the Release phase. Your nervous system needs time to rebuild those pathways. Two weeks of Release and you'll feel muscles you didn't know existed. Then we Restore. Most people skip straight to Re-Engineer—that's why they fail. Follow the R3 sequence and you'll have feet that perform, not just feet that exist.
