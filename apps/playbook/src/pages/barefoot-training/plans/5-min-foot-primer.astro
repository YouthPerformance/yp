  <h2>Common Questions</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Can I do this on days I'm also training for my sport?</strong><br/>
    Yes—in fact, this makes a great warm-up. Do it before practice, games, or workouts.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What if I can't do one of the exercises?</strong><br/>
    That's exactly why you need it. Keep practicing—the neural connections will develop.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Is this enough for real results?</strong><br/>
    Yes, for the first 2-4 weeks. This routine builds the foundation. Skipping it leads to the "too much too soon" injuries we warn about.
