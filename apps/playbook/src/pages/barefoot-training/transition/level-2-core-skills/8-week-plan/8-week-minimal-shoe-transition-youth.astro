  <h2>Phase 1: Wake Up (Weeks 1-2)</h2>
  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Activate intrinsic foot muscles. No minimalist shoes yet.</p>

  <CoachVoice author="james">
    Week 4 is where most people feel great and want to speed up. Don't. Your muscles are adapting faster than your tendons. The real adaptation is happening at the tissue level—you just can't feel it yet.

  <h2>Phase 3: Introduce Minimal Shoes (Weeks 5-6)</h2>
  <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Begin wearing minimalist footwear for short periods.</p>

  <h2>Phase 4: Extend Duration (Weeks 7-8)</h2>

  <h2>After Week 8</h2>
  <p>
    Congratulations—your feet are now adapted to minimalist footwear for daily wear. But transitioning to minimal shoes <em>for sport</em> is a separate, longer process. Continue wearing minimal shoes for daily activities while keeping your sport-specific shoes for training.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sport-specific barefoot/minimal shoe integration typically takes an additional 4-8 weeks and depends on the specific demands of your sport. See our sport-specific guides for basketball, soccer, running, and more.
  </p>

  <h2>Red Flags During Transition</h2>
  <div class="bg-action-orange/10 border border-action-orange/30 rounded-lg p-5 my-6">
    <p class="font-semibold text-action-orange mb-2">Stop and reassess if you experience:</p>
    <ul class="space-y-1">
      <li>• Persistent calf soreness beyond 48 hours</li>
      <li>• Achilles tendon discomfort</li>
      <li>• Arch pain during or after wearing minimal shoes</li>
      <li>• Any pain that worsens as you progress</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-sm text-bark-muted mt-3">
      → Go back one phase, reduce duration by 50%, and progress more slowly
