  directAnswer:
    "<strong>Youth basketball drills should focus on ball-handling, footwork, shooting form, and decision-making—scaled by age.</strong> For ages 7–9, keep drills game-like and under 5 minutes each. Ages 10–13 can handle more structured repetition with basic reads. By 14–18, add intensity, live decision-making, and conditioning. The best drill is one the player will actually do consistently.",

const faqs = [
  {
    question: "How many days a week should youth players practice basketball?",
    answer:
      "For ages 7–12, 2–3 organized practices per week is ideal, with informal play encouraged on other days. For ages 13+, 3–4 sessions including games is appropriate. Rest days are critical—overtraining leads to burnout and injury.",
  },
  {
    question: "What basketball drills can kids do in an apartment?",
    answer:
      "Silent ball-handling drills work great indoors: low pounds, stationary crossovers on carpet, form shooting without a hoop (focus on release), and footwork ladders. Use a deflated or foam ball if noise is a concern. Our Silent Pound Series is perfect for apartment training.",
  },
  {
    question: "At what age should kids start basketball training?",
    answer:
      "Kids can start basketball fundamentals as young as 5–6 through play-based activities. Structured skill training typically begins around age 7–8. Before that, focus on general athleticism: running, jumping, catching, and coordination games.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the best basketball drills for beginners?",
    answer:
      "Start with stationary ball-handling (pounds, circles around waist/legs), basic layup progressions from close range, and form shooting 3–5 feet from the basket. Focus on technique before speed or distance. The Figure 8 Wrap is a great starting point.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long should youth basketball practice be?",
    answer:
      "Ages 7–9: 30–45 minutes. Ages 10–13: 45–60 minutes. Ages 14+: 60–90 minutes. Younger players need more variety and shorter drill segments to stay engaged. Always end on a positive note.",

  <p>Not all drills work for all ages. A 7-year-old and a 15-year-old need completely different approaches. Here's how I break it down when I'm working with young players:</p>

  <table class="content-table">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Age Band</th>

      <tr>
        <td><span class="age-badge age-7-9">Ages 7–9</span></td>
        <td>Coordination, fun, body control, ambidextrous play</td>
        <td>30–45 min, mostly games</td>
        <td>Dribble tag, Statues, Red Light Green Light with ball</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="age-badge age-10-13">Ages 10–13</span></td>
        <td>Footwork, layup progressions, basic reads, ball-handling combos</td>
        <td>45–60 min, structured with games</td>
        <td>Two-ball dribbling, Form shooting, 1v1 closeouts</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="age-badge age-14-18">Ages 14–18</span></td>
        <td>Decision-making under fatigue, shooting volume, advanced reads</td>
        <td>60–90 min, high intensity intervals</td>
        <td>3v3 live, Transition finishing, Conditioning circuits</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>

    What I look for in a 10-year-old isn't what I look for in a 15-year-old. At 10, I want to see them comfortable with the ball in both hands. At 15, I want to see them make decisions at game speed. Same drills won't get you there.

  <p>Ball-handling is the foundation. A player who can control the ball can create opportunities. Here are the drills I use most:</p>

  <!-- Chapter 3: Shooting -->
  <SectionHeader
    id="shooting"
    chapter="Chapter III"
    title="Shooting Drills"
  />

  <p>Shooting form should be locked in before distance or volume increases. I see too many young players chucking from three-point range before they can make a layup consistently.</p>

  <CoachVoice author="adam">
    Form before distance. Always. I'd rather see a kid shoot 100 perfect shots from 5 feet than 100 broken shots from the three-point line. Build the muscle memory first.

  <!-- Chapter 4: Footwork -->

    title="Footwork & Defense Drills"

  <p>Footwork separates good players from great players. It's the most underrated skill in youth basketball.</p>

  <CoachVoice author="adam">
    Here's what I tell my NBA guys—your feet are your foundation. Before I get into footwork drills, I make sure their feet can actually do the work. James Scott's R3 Method changed how I think about foot training. Strong feet = faster first step. It's that simple.

    The drill isn't hard—doing it right is hard. I watch kids rush through drills to get to the game. Slow down. If you can't do it slow, you can't do it fast. Same technique I use with pros, scaled for age.
