## BRIEF 1: Speed Training Pillar Page
### "Youth Speed Training: The Complete Guide to Faster Athletes"

**URL:** `/speed-training/`
**Target Keyword:** "youth speed training" (8.1K monthly searches)
**Secondary Keywords:** speed training for kids, sprint training youth, first step quickness

**Search Intent:** Parents/coaches looking for comprehensive speed training guidance

**The Hook:**
> Speed is the great equalizer. A faster athlete gets to the ball first, beats defenders, and creates separation. But most "speed training" for youth is wrong. Here's what actually works.

**Sections to Write:**

1. **What Is Speed Training?** (R3 framing)
   - Speed = skill, not just genetics
   - The 3 components: acceleration, max velocity, deceleration
   - Why most youth speed programs fail

2. **When Should Kids Start Speed Training?**
   - Ages 6-9: Play-based, not formal training
   - Ages 10-13: Introduce mechanics, short sprints
   - Ages 14+: Structured speed development
   - The "windows of opportunity" concept

3. **The Speed Fundamentals**
   - Posture and body position
   - Arm action (the forgotten key)
   - Ground contact and force production
   - The role of the feet (tie to barefoot training)

4. **Speed Drills by Age** (DrillCards)
   - Ages 7-9: Chase games, animal movements, short sprints
   - Ages 10-13: Wall drills, A-skips, acceleration builds
   - Ages 14-18: Resisted sprints, flying sprints, complex drills

5. **Common Speed Training Mistakes**
   - Too much volume, not enough rest
   - Ignoring mechanics for "more running"
   - Training tired = training slow
   - Skipping the foundation (strength, balance)

6. **How Speed Connects to R3**
   - REPAIR: Mobility and posture work
   - REINFORCE: Strength and stability
   - RELOAD: Actual speed work

**Drills to Include:**
- [ ] Wall Drive Hold (posture awareness)

**Target Keyword:** "landing mechanics youth athletes" (800 monthly searches)
**Secondary Keywords:** ACL injury prevention, safe landing technique, jump landing drills

**Search Intent:** Parents/coaches concerned about injury prevention

**The Hook:**
> 70% of ACL tears happen during landing or deceleration—not contact. Yet we spend all our time teaching kids to jump higher and run faster, and zero time teaching them to land safely. This is the most important skill in youth sports that almost no one teaches.

**Sections to Write:**

1. **The Landing Crisis in Youth Sports**
   - ACL injury statistics (especially in girls)
   - Why landing matters more than jumping

   - Poor supervision and technique
   - Too much weight, too soon
   - Ego lifting / showing off
   - Overtraining (too much volume)

4. **The Benefits Outweigh the Risks**
   - Injury prevention (reduced injury rates by 50%+)
   - Better motor control
   - Stronger bones
   - Healthier habits

5. **Guidelines by Age**
   - Ages 6-9: Bodyweight, play-based
   - Ages 10-12: Light resistance, technique focus

**Secondary Keywords:** cutting drills, lateral movement training, COD training youth

**Search Intent:** Coaches/athletes wanting specific COD improvement

**The Hook:**
> The best athletes don't just run fast in straight lines—they change direction explosively while everyone else is still planting their foot. This is the skill that creates separation, beats defenders, and wins games.

**Sections to Write:**

1. **Change of Direction vs. Agility**
   - COD = pre-planned direction change
   - Agility = reactive direction change
   - You need both, but COD comes first

2. **The Mechanics of Cutting**

   - Plant foot mechanics
   - Re-acceleration (exploding in new direction)
   - The "crossover vs. shuffle" decision

3. **Types of Cuts**
   - Speed cut (45 degrees, minimal slowdown)
   - Hard cut (90 degrees, full decel/reaccel)
   - Crossover cut (outside foot plants, opposite direction)
   - Shuffle cut (lateral movement, no crossing)

4. **COD Drills by Level** (DrillCards)
   - Level 1: Lateral shuffle, cone touches
   - Level 2: 5-10-5 shuttle, L-drill
   - Level 3: W-drill, box drill
   - Level 4: Reactive COD with partner

**Target Keyword:** "core exercises for young athletes" (1.8K monthly searches)
**Secondary Keywords:** core training youth, ab exercises for kids, core stability athletes

**Search Intent:** Coaches/parents wanting proper core training guidance

**The Hook:**
> Forget six-pack abs. That's not what core training is about. The core is your body's transmission—it transfers power from your legs through your torso to your arms. A weak core means power leaks. Here's how to build a core that performs.

**Sections to Write:**

1. **What Is the Core (Really)?**
   - Not just the abs
   - The entire cylinder: abs, obliques, lower back, glutes, hip flexors
   - Function: anti-rotation, anti-extension, anti-flexion

2. **Why Core Training Matters for Athletes**
   - Power transfer
   - Posture and position
   - Injury prevention (especially lower back)
   - Sport skill execution

3. **The Anti-Movement Approach**
   - Traditional: Create movement (sit-ups, crunches)
   - Athletic: Resist movement (planks, Pallof, carries)
   - Why resisting is more sport-specific

4. **Core Exercises by Function** (DrillCards)
   - Anti-Extension: Dead bug, plank
   - Anti-Rotation: Pallof press, bird dog
   - Anti-Flexion: Good morning, back extension
   - Rotation: Medicine ball throws (for older athletes)

5. **The Core Training Mistake Everyone Makes**
   - Too much flexion work (crunches)
   - Not enough stability work
   - Training tired (poor form)

6. **Sample Core Routine (8 min)**
   - Dead Bug: 2x10 each side
   - Side Plank: 2x20 sec each side
   - Bird Dog: 2x10 each side
   - Pallof Hold: 2x15 sec each side

**Drills to Include:**
