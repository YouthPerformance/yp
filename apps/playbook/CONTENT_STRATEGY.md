## The R3 Framework Content Model

### R3 = Repair → Reinforce → Reload

This is the philosophical backbone:

| Phase | Focus | Content Type |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| **REPAIR** | Fix dysfunction, restore mobility | Injury rehab, mobility, flexibility |
| **REINFORCE** | Build strength, stability, control | Strength, balance, proprioception |
| **RELOAD** | Add speed, power, sport-specificity | Speed, agility, plyometrics |

Every piece of content maps to one of these phases.
