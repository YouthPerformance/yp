# YP CONVERSION ENGINE — PRD + App Spec v2.0 (Parent-Focused)

**Project:** YP Conversion Engine — Parent-First Funnel → Bulletproof Ankles → Quiz Identity → Barefoot Reset Tripwire ($88) → Academy App (Masterclass Mode)

---

## 1) Executive Decisions (Locked)

### Pricing Model (Tripwire / SLO)
- **Barefoot Reset = one-time $88** (premium positioning)
- Positioning:
  - "Normally included in the **$29/mo Academy**."
  - "Get **lifetime access to this specific protocol** for a one-time **$88**."
- Goal: Acquire customer + card with minimal friction; upsell in-app.
- Parent focus: Parents are the primary decision-makers and purchasers

### Lead Magnet Delivery Format (No PDF-first)
- **Bulletproof Ankles delivered as:**
  - a clean mobile web page (AEO-friendly, SEO-capable)
  - with a **Start Stack** button that runs in the **Stack Runner (mobile web)**
- Email is still valuable—but the asset itself lives on web.

### Teen Email Gate (Soft Gate)
- Teens (13+) can:
  - start the stack
  - complete the quiz
  - see their **Identity name**
- But to get:
  - the **7-day fix plan**
  - the **protocol details**
  - and to **save streak / progress**
- They hit: **"Where should we send your fix?"** (email capture)

---

## 2) Product Summary

We are shifting YP from a brochure to an **active conversion engine**:

**Landing → 5-step "Build my kid's plan" → Bulletproof Ankles page (instant value) → Start Stack → Completion → Save + Meet your Wolf (email + kid nickname) → Ask Wolf → Offer Barefoot Reset ($88)**

---

## 3) Goals

### Business Goals
- Capture emails at scale without killing teen conversion (soft gate)
- Convert leads into **Barefoot Reset $37** purchases
- Drive post-purchase activation: **start Day 1 + complete Week 1**

### User Goals (Sage + Hero)
- **Parents:** safe, clear, simple plan with "what to do next"
- **Athletes:** fast win + identity + mission
- **Coaches:** warmup plug-in + share to parents

---

## 4) Non-goals (v1)
- Computer vision feedback
- Social leaderboards/friends
- Multi-sport subscriptions
- Full coach dashboard/teams (we do virality code instead)
- Deep personalization beyond role/age/sport/space/pain flag

---

## 5) Core Personas

### Parent / Guardian
- Wants safety and structure
- Compliance needs (under-13)

### Athlete (13+)
- Wants instant value
- Low patience; hates gates

### Coach (volunteer/club)
- Needs practice-ready warmup
- Can drive multi-lead growth via team challenge code

---

## 6) Funnel Flow (Detailed)

### Step A — Landing Page (Astro)

**Hero:**
- Headline: THE PRO SPORTS ACADEMY IN YOUR POCKET.
- Subhead: Elite training, democratized. Master the 15-minute daily habits used by pros to build speed and prevent injuries. Enroll now.
- **Primary CTA:** Join the Pack
- **Secondary CTA:** Get Bulletproof Ankles (Free)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] CTA opens Start Here modal (or `/start` fallback)
- [ ] UTM parameters persist through funnel

---

### Step B — Start Here (Modal or /start)

**Purpose:** segment + safety + constraints

**Inputs (5 taps):**
1. Role: Parent / Athlete / Coach
2. Age: athlete confirms **13+** yes/no; parent selects child age band
3. Sport: Basketball / Barefoot / Both / Other
4. Where train: Apartment / Driveway / Gym / Field
5. Pain now: No / Foot-ankle / Knee-hip-back / Not sure

**Output:** "Your starter plan is ready" → Continue to Bulletproof Ankles page
*(No email required at this step for 13+ athletes.)*

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Under-13 athletes are routed to parent flow messaging
- [ ] Pain flag adjusts default plan intensity and surfaces extra stop rules

---

### Step C — Bulletproof Ankles Web Page (Astro)

This is the **asset**, not a PDF.

**Page must include:**
- Answer-first (2–3 sentences)
- Key takeaways
- Safety / stop rules (accordion)
- Age band toggles
- **Start Stack** button (deep links to Stack Runner)
- "Save streak" lock (greyed until profile created)

**Key growth mechanic:**
At the bottom / after stack:
- "Complete" button appears, but:
  - **saving completion** requires profile/email
  - completion UI can be "locked" (grey) until login/profile

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Page loads fast on mobile
- [ ] Stack Runner launches with no login
- [ ] Save progress requires profile

---

### Step D — Stack Runner (Next.js, mobile web)

**Goal:** first win

After stack completion:
- CTA: "Take the 2-minute Athlete Type Quiz"
- CTA: "Save your streak" (gated)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Anonymous users can complete the stack
- [ ] Completion can display celebration, but saving requires account

---

### Step E — Quiz (Web)

**Teens:** can complete without email
**Parents/coaches:** can complete without email (email already captured or optional)

Quiz output:
- Identity name (Force Leaker / Elasticity Block / Absorption Deficit / Control Gap)
- Short "What it means"
- **Fix plan is locked** until email capture (soft gate for 13+ athletes)

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Identity name always visible
- [ ] "Fix plan" section is blurred/locked until email captured
- [ ] Email capture copy: "Where should we send your fix?"

---

### Step F — Offer: Barefoot Reset ($88 one-time)

---

### Step I — Coach Virality Loop (Trojan Horse)

After coach gets Bulletproof Ankles:
- generates a unique code: `COACH-MIKE-2025`
- share prompt: "Send to parents"

---

## 12) Identity Types (Quiz Results)

### 1) FORCE LEAKER
**Cold reading:** "You look explosive in the first 10 minutes... then something weird happens. Your first step feels half a beat slower. Cuts feel a little sloppy. You're not gassed—your stabilizers are."

**Sage explanation:** "When the foot/ankle system can't hold a clean position under speed, force leaks on every plant."

**Outcomes when fixed:**
- Cuts feel sharper
- Stops feel cleaner
- Landings get quieter
- Confidence goes up

### 2) ELASTICITY BLOCK
**Cold reading:** "You do the work. You grind. But you don't feel bouncy. You feel... stuck to the floor. Like your legs are strong, but your movement doesn't 'snap.'"

**Sage:** "Elasticity is the ability to load and return force smoothly. If the foot/ankle chain is stiff or mistimed, you lose spring."

### 3) ABSORPTION DEFICIT
**Cold reading:** "Loud. Heavy. Sometimes your knees or shins feel 'worked' even when the session wasn't insane."

**Sage:** "Absorption is controlled deceleration. If the foot/ankle chain isn't absorbing force, impact travels upward."

### 4) CONTROL GAP
**Cold reading:** "You have days where you feel smooth... and days where you feel clunky for no reason. Same body. Same effort. Different result."

**Sage:** "Control is repeatability. If your base position changes rep to rep, your whole chain changes."
