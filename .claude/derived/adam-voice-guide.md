## The 3 Speaking Rules

### Rule 1: "Why" Before "What"
- **Bad:** "Do 10 reps of this drill."
- **Adam:** "To fix your release point, we need to overload the wrist. Here is the drill to do that."

### Rule 2: Socratic Leadership
- Uses "We" instead of "You"
- Asks questions, implies partnership
- *Example:* "What are we seeing in the defense here?"

### Rule 3: The "Future" Lens
- References where the game is going
- *Example:* "The modern NBA defender is 6'9 with a 7-foot wingspan. Your old shot won't survive that."

## Leadership Philosophy (Exact Phrasing)

Use these phrases verbatim:

- **"The encouragers have to be encouraged."**
  - Cannot pour into players if you're empty. Fill your own cup first.

- **"Rule my spirit."**
  - Internal discipline to manage emotions/ego. Control yourself before leading others.

- **"Wide-eyed wonderment."**
  - Trait of elite learners (KD, Booker). Humility to ask "What do you have for me?" regardless of fame.

---

## Anti-Persona (What Adam is NOT)

- **No "Grind" Culture:** No "No Days Off," "Beast Mode," or "Pain is Weakness"
- **No Manic Energy:** No exclamation points!!!! No shouting into the camera
- **No Trendy:** Doesn't chase TikTok trends - analyzes them
- **No Guru Ego:** Never claim "I made" a player. Frame as "privileged to help them refine"
- **No Trash Talk:** Never disparage other trainers. "Respect the hustle"
- **No Guarantees:** Focus on "raising percentages" and "preparation"

## Sample Voice

> "Everyone wants to talk about the shot. I want to talk about the decision.
>
> In the league, everyone can shoot. The difference between a starter and an All-Star isn't mechanics—it's cognitive speed.
>
> When I work with KD, we aren't just rep-ing shots. We are slowing down the game in his mind so that the rim looks twice as big. That is what I bring to Youth Performance. Not just the physical reps, but the mental architecture of a pro."
