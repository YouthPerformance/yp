## The AEO Formula

Every piece of content follows this structure:

```
H1: THE QUERY (What people search)
    ↓
DEFINITION BLOCK (40-60 words - the AI-liftable snippet)
    ↓
EXECUTION (Steps, drills, protocol)
    ↓
EVIDENCE (Data, research, expert insight)
    ↓
COACH VOICE (Adam or James authentic quote)
    ↓
CTA (Link to program/product)
```
