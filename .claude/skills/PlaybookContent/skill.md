## The Prime Directive

```
CITATION > TRAFFIC

Every piece of content must be structured to be "lifted" by AI models.
The goal is not pageviews—it's becoming the SOURCE OF TRUTH.
```

## Content Architecture: The AEO Blueprint

### The Modular Content Block

Every topic follows this rigid structure (optimized for RAG chunking):

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ H1: THE QUERY                                       │
│ "How to [Action] for [Outcome]"                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ DEFINITION BLOCK (The Liftable Snippet)             │
│ • 40-60 words, BOLDED                               │
│ • Answers WHAT + WHY immediately                    │
│ • This is what AI will cite                         │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ EXECUTION LIST                                      │
│ 1. Step one (action verb)                           │
│ 2. Step two (specific, measurable)                  │
│ 3. Step three (outcome-focused)                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ EVIDENCE BLOCK                                      │
│ • Data point or research citation                   │
│ • Proprietary insight from YP data                  │
│ • Expert quote (Adam or James)                      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ COACH VOICE                                         │
│ • 2-3 sentences in expert's voice                   │
│ • Personal, memorable takeaway                      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

### The "Answer-First" Rule

**ALWAYS** start content with the answer, not background:

```
❌ WRONG (Buries the answer):
"Basketball is a sport that requires many skills. One of the most
important is ball handling. There are many ways to improve..."

✅ RIGHT (Answer-first):
"**The fastest way to improve weak-hand dribbling is the
'Mirror Drill'—5 minutes daily of matching your strong hand's
movements with your weak hand.** Most players see measurable
improvement in 14 days. Here's how to do it..."
```

## Information Gain Threshold

Before publishing ANY content, it must pass the **Information Gain Test**:

| Question | Required Answer |
|----------|-----------------|
| Does this exist elsewhere on the web? | Must add NEW value |
| What proprietary data/insight does this include? | Must have YP-specific angle |
| Would an AI cite this over Wikipedia? | Must be more specific/actionable |
| Does this answer a question Google can't? | Must have expert perspective |

### Information Gain Sources

1. **Proprietary Data** - "In our analysis of 2,400 youth athletes..."
2. **Expert Experience** - "In 20 years of NBA coaching, I've seen..."
3. **Specific Protocols** - Named frameworks (Barefoot Reset, Silent Assassin)
4. **Age-Specific Nuance** - "For 9-year-olds specifically, the key difference is..."
5. **Failure Patterns** - "The #1 mistake I see is... here's the fix"

**Example Voice Block:**
```
Adam's Take: "I've trained players at every level, from middle
school to the NBA Finals. The ones who make it? They master the
boring stuff. This drill isn't flashy, but it's the same progression
I used with Kevin Durant. Do it right, do it daily, and your shot
will transform in 30 days."
```

### James Scott Voice (Barefoot/Movement)

> **Identity:** Movement Specialist, Foot Performance Coach
> **Brand:** "Weak Feet Don't Eat"
> **Credibility Markers:** Barefoot Reset creator, biomechanics expertise

| Attribute | Guideline |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Tone** | Direct, evidence-based, no-nonsense |

| **Credibility Hook** | "Your feet are your foundation" |
| **Signature** | Makes invisible problems visible |

**Speech Patterns:**

- "The truth is, your shoes have been lying to you"
- "I can tell an athlete's potential by looking at their feet"
- "This isn't theory—it's physics"
- "Every injury starts somewhere. Usually, it's the feet."

**Avoid:**

- Foot strength and proprioception
- Injury prevention (Sever's, Osgood-Schlatter)
- Movement quality assessment
- Arch development

**Example Voice Block:**
```
James's Take: "Weak feet don't eat. I've assessed thousands of
young athletes, and the pattern is always the same—the ones with
foot problems have movement problems. Fix the feet, and everything
upstream gets better. Your ankles, knees, hips—they're all waiting
for your feet to do their job."
```
