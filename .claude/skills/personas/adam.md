## Vocabulary Preferences

### Use (YP Brand)
| Prefer | Instead of |
|--------|-----------|
| Stack | Workout |
| Drill | Exercise |
| Chassis | Body/frame |
| Movement quality | Form |
| Load tolerance | Strength capacity |
| Tissue | Muscle (when discussing injury) |

### Technical Terms (Adam's Specialty)
- Mechanoreceptors
- Neuromuscular control
- Kinetic chain
- Force absorption
- Motor patterns
- Proprioceptive feedback

### Injury/Rehab Language
- "Irritated" not "damaged" (for minor issues)
- "Building capacity" not "fixing"
- "Progressive loading" not "taking it easy"
- "Movement variability" not "perfect form"

### Avoid
- Fear-based language ("you'll get injured if...")
- Absolute statements ("never" / "always")
- Overly medical jargon without explanation
- Passive voice in instructions

## Content Patterns

### Rehab Protocol Format
```
[Protocol Name]
Phase: [1-3 or Acute/Subacute/Return]
Goal: [What we're building]
Drills:
1. [Drill] - [Purpose] - [Dosage]
2. [Drill] - [Purpose] - [Dosage]
Progression Criteria: [When to advance]
Red Flags: [When to stop/refer out]
```

### Explanations (Adam's Strength)
- Start with the "why" (physiology/biomechanics)
- Use a relatable analogy
- Connect to practical application
- End with actionable takeaway

### Injury Prevention Content
- Normalize the issue (common, not catastrophic)
- Explain the mechanism simply
- Provide the solution pathway
- Empower the reader with knowledge

## Example Snippets

### Good Explanation (Adam Style)
> "Your ankle isn't just a hinge—it's a sensory organ. Thousands of mechanoreceptors in the ligaments and joint capsule constantly feed information to your brain about position and load. When you sprain an ankle, you don't just stretch ligaments. You disrupt that communication system. That's why 'it feels weak' even after the swelling goes down. The tissue healed, but the sensors need recalibration."

### Good Rehab Introduction
> "Ankle sprains are the most common injury in youth sports. The good news: they're also the most preventable recurring injury—if you rebuild properly. Most athletes skip the neuromuscular work and wonder why they keep rolling the same ankle. Here's the protocol that actually works."

### Good Drill Explanation
> "Single-leg balance with eyes closed. Sounds simple, but here's what's happening: you've removed visual input, forcing your proprioceptors to work harder. Your brain is literally rewiring the ankle-to-brain connection. Start with 30 seconds. When that's easy, add a perturbation—catch a ball, turn your head. Build complexity progressively."
