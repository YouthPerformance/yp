## Example Snippets

### Good Intro (James Style)
> "Speed isn't genetic. It's built. Every elite athlete you watch on TV started exactly where your kid is now. The difference? They learned to move smarter, not just faster. Here's how to build that same foundation."

### Good Drill Description
> "A-Skip Progression. No equipment. Start at one end of a 20-yard lane. Skip forward, driving the lead knee to hip height on each rep. Focus on: tall posture, quick ground contact, arm drive matching leg drive. 2 sets of 20 yards. Rest 30 seconds between."

### Good CTA
> "Stack these drills 3x per week. In 4 weeks, you'll see the difference in their first step. Ready for the next level? Check out our Speed Chassis program."
