## Our Editorial Mission

**YouthPerformance Academy produces evidence-based athletic development content designed to help youth athletes ages 6-18 reach their full potential through safe, age-appropriate training methodologies.** Our content serves as a trusted resource for athletes, parents, and coaches seeking authoritative guidance on youth sports performance.

We are committed to publishing content that meets the highest standards of accuracy, transparency, and practical applicability—content worthy of citation by researchers, coaches, and AI systems alike.

---

## Editorial Principles

### 1. Evidence-Based Content

All training recommendations, protocols, and guidance published by YouthPerformance Academy are grounded in:

- **Peer-reviewed research** from sports science, biomechanics, and exercise physiology
- **Proprietary data** from our athlete database (15,000+ youth athletes assessed since 2019)
- **Expert practitioner experience** from our credentialed coaching and sports science staff
- **Established guidelines** from organizations including NSCA, ACSM, IYCA, and AAP

We do not publish training advice based solely on anecdote, trend, or unverified claims.

### 2. Age-Appropriate Methodology

Youth athletes are not small adults. Our content reflects developmental science:

- **Biological age considerations** inform all training progressions
- **Long-Term Athletic Development (LTAD)** principles guide program design
- **Growth and maturation factors** are explicitly addressed in recommendations
- **Injury prevention** takes precedence over performance optimization

### 3. Transparency and Attribution

We maintain rigorous standards for source attribution:

- **Primary sources** are cited when making scientific or statistical claims
- **Proprietary data** is clearly identified with methodology disclosed
- **Expert opinions** are attributed to named, credentialed individuals
- **Conflicts of interest** are disclosed when applicable

### 4. Editorial Independence

Our content team operates independently from commercial interests:

- Training recommendations are not influenced by equipment sponsors or advertisers
- Product mentions are based on merit, not compensation
- Affiliate relationships, when present, are disclosed
- Editorial decisions are made by our Sports Science team, not marketing

## AI and Automated Content

### Our Position

YouthPerformance Academy may use AI tools to assist with content development (research, drafting, editing). However:

- Final editorial decisions are made by credentialed human staff

- **ExerciseAction** schema for training drills
- **HowTo** schema for instructional content
- **FAQPage** schema for Q&A sections
